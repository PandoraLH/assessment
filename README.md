## How to run the code 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## What I did 
- Implement the interface for Login Page and Profile Page
- Validate Input for the Email and Phone 
- Login function to check if email or password are corrected 
- Navigate to the user profile if the user logged in 
- Update the User profile and put it in the console 

## What I think I didn't do well
- Forget to implement Private Route so user can navigate directly to profile/1 (this is a fatal mistake ) 
- Don't update JSON file. Because the scope of the project is small, so I don't create a server with and API endpoint to handle GET and POST. I just create a JSON file
with user information in the ./src. But I got experienced working with API so I think I could do well with an API endpoint too.
